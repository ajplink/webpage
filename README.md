# Associação Plink — website

Static website for **Associação Plink**, a Portuguese national youth association
that runs pedagogical STEM projects for young people and supports educators.
Built with **Astro** (static output), **TypeScript strict**, content collections,
and plain CSS. **Zero client-side JavaScript.**

- Languages: **pt-PT** (default) · **en-GB** — `/pt/`, `/en-gb/` (en-US was
  retired in Oct 2026; its content lives under `archive/`)
  (the Portuguese home is additionally served at `/`).
- Content is Markdown/MDX files: adding content never requires touching code
  (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), in Portuguese).
- No cookies, no analytics, no third-party requests at runtime.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:4321
npm run build      # astro check && astro build → dist/
npm run preview    # serve dist/ locally
npm run contrast   # WCAG contrast check of the design tokens
```

## Stack and why each dependency is here

| Package | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `astro` | Static site framework (fixed by the brief). Static output, no server. |
| `@astrojs/sitemap` | `sitemap-index.xml` with hreflang alternates per locale. |
| `@astrojs/rss` | Per-locale news feed at `/<locale>/rss.xml`. |
| `@fontsource-variable/fraunces` | Self-hosted display serif (Latin subsets fetched at runtime via `unicode-range`), OFL-licensed, no CDN. "Standard" file keeps Fraunces' character axes (wonk/soft/opsz). |
| `@fontsource-variable/space-grotesk` | Self-hosted body/UI sans (Latin subsets via `unicode-range`), OFL-licensed, no CDN. Weight-only variable file. |
| `@astrojs/check`, `typescript` (dev) | `astro check` in `npm run build` (zero warnings enforced). |

Nothing else. No UI framework, no CSS framework, no client JS. (Svelte will be
added later **only** for the interactive simulations.)

## Rebranding in 5 minutes

1. **Colours** — `src/styles/tokens.css`, block 1 (*brand palette*): `--palette-blue`,
   `--palette-pink`, `--palette-yellow`, `--palette-green`, `--palette-orange`,
   `--palette-black`, `--palette-white`. Everything semantic derives from them.
   Then run `npm run contrast` — all pairs must stay ≥ 4.5:1 (AA).
   Dark mode overrides are in the same file, at the bottom.
2. **Fonts** — `src/styles/tokens.css`, `--font-sans` / `--font-display`, plus the
   `@fontsource-variable/…` import in `src/layouts/Base.astro` (one family today).
3. **Identity** — `src/config/site.ts`: name, legal name, NIPC, address, e-mail,
   social links, tagline, description, footer text.
4. **URLs** — localized slugs live in `src/i18n/routes.ts` (one line per locale).
5. **Favicon / OG image** — `public/favicon.svg` and `public/og-placeholder.png`
   mirror the palette by hand (SVG favicons can't read CSS variables). The
   placeholder covers in `src/assets/covers/` are currently unreferenced (no
   content entry sets `cover:`) — bring them back on brand if content starts
   using covers again.

## Adding content

One file per item, one folder per locale — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for copy-paste templates (team member, event, news post, project, page).
Rules in short: the `pt` file is the source of truth for dates/tags/status;
translated files carry the text fields; a missing translation falls back to
Portuguese and the page still exists at its locale URL.

## Performance and verification

Measured on the static build (`npm run build`, then `npm run preview` or any
static server) with Lighthouse 13.5.0 (mobile emulation, simulated throttling)
on 25 Oct 2026:

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best practices | SEO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/pt/` (home) | 98 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/pt/projetos/` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/pt/noticias/` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/pt/noticias/apresentacao-plink/` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/pt/doacoes/` | 99 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

⚠️ **Never measure `npm run dev`** — the dev server injects the Vite client and
the Astro dev toolbar (~1 MB of JS) and halves the performance score. Always
measure the built output.

Page weight (home, excluding images): **112 KB** — HTML 16 KB + CSS 5 KB + JS
2 KB (all gzip) + Fraunces 67 KB and Space Grotesk 22 KB (woff2, Latin subsets
only; latin-ext/vietnamese stay unfetched thanks to `unicode-range`). Inside
the 150 KB budget. (Was 65 KB with the single Bricolage family; the display
serif is what carries the extra 47 KB.) Images are excluded from the
budget and are emitted by Astro as AVIF/WebP with explicit dimensions.

Reproduce (Lighthouse is intentionally not a project dependency):

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview &
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4321/pt/ \
  --chrome-flags="--headless=new --no-sandbox" --output=json
npm run contrast
```

(`astro preview` falls back to another port if the dev server holds 4321 —
hit the port the preview prints, and note the dev server must not be measured.)

Accessibility verified beyond Lighthouse: keyboard-only navigation (skip link
focuses first), one `h1` per page, no heading-level jumps, landmarks, `lang`
attributes per locale, visible focus rings, 320 px without horizontal overflow,
`prefers-reduced-motion` respected.

## Hosting

Output is hosting-agnostic: `dist/` after `npm run build`.

**Public test page (GitHub Pages, free):** a public mirror deploys from
`layzyoldman/webpage-test` at `https://layzyoldman.github.io/webpage-test/`.
Its existence is one command: `scripts/pages.sh on` (sync + deploy) /
`scripts/pages.sh off` (site 404s, repo and history stay) /
`scripts/pages.sh status`. The deploy workflow computes the base path from
the repo name, so the same build works at a domain root or under `/<repo>/`
(`BASE_PATH` env). Pages ignores `public/_headers`, so security headers do
not apply on the test page — fine for testing, not for production.
`public/_headers` ships security headers (CSP without third-party origins,
HSTS, frame denial) and cache policy (`/_astro/*` immutable, HTML revalidated
by the host's ETag). COOP/COEP for future `/simulacoes/*` routes is prepared
there as commented-out rules — **never enable it site-wide**.

Canonical URLs use a trailing slash (`/pt/sobre/`), matching the directory
output. `/` mirrors the Portuguese home with a canonical pointing at `/pt/`.
Update `SITE.url` in `src/config/site.ts` before going live (currently the
placeholder `https://plink.example`).

## Decisions worth reviewing

1. **Two locales: `pt` + `en-gb`** (`en-gb → pt` fallback). en-US was retired
   at Ricardo's request — the content was archived, not deleted. Adding a
   locale later is one line in `LOCALES` + one folder per collection.
2. **Event status is derived from dates** (`upcoming`/`past`), never typed;
   `cancelled` is the only hand-set status (frontmatter `cancelled: true`).
3. **`/pt/…` is canonical; `/` mirrors the home only** (other pt pages are not
   duplicated at the root).
4. **Project filters are pure CSS** (`:has()` + radio inputs). Browsers without
   `:has()` simply show all projects. No JS, no announcements to screen readers
   when filtering — revisit if that matters to users.
5. **Drafts are schema-validated** (a broken draft fails the build on purpose)
   but never listed, generated or fed to RSS.
6. **Layout choice**: `text-wrap: balance` on headings, hanging punctuation —
   small editorial touches that can be removed in `global.css`.
