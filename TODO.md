# TODO — Plink site rework

**Status 25 Oct 2026 (Ricardo's pass):** everything actionable is done and
verified (see "Verification pass" below). What remains is real-world data
("Still open — need Ricardo") and one housekeeping question (the orphan cover
PNGs). Several items below had already been shipped by earlier commits without
being ticked — they are now verified and ticked.

## Ricardo's batches (23 Oct) — status

- [x] **Wordmark writes properly** — root cause of the cut view: `<mask>`
      default region clips the artwork in Chrome AND Firefox; explicit region
      fixed it. Verified: writes 0→100% by 1.1 s, ticks blink in at 1.4 s.
- [x] **Lights on faster, tighter writing** (final tune: pen stroke 700,
      sparks at 0.88× of the write).
- [x] **Favicon = the three yellow ticks** of the wordmark.
- [x] **Revolver idea — removed** (misunderstood; the component is parked in
      `archive/revolver-component.astro`, nothing deleted).
- [x] **Team = Órgãos Sociais** (Direção, Conselho Fiscal, Mesa da Assembleia)
      + departments with the real names (DREE = Relações Educativas e
      Empresariais, DCI = Comunicação e Imagem, DL/DP confirmed).
- [x] **Carousels auto-scroll** (CSS marquee, pauses on hover/focus, manual
      scroll under reduced motion).
- [x] **Team page stripped** to names and people.
- [x] **Footer**: small, horizontal, icon socials (no YouTube), no tagline.
- [x] **Font**: Bricolage Grotesque Variable (OFL, single family).
- [x] **Wider page** (container 84rem).
- [x] **404 in both languages**.
- [x] **Two locales only** — en-US retired, content archived under `archive/`.
- [x] **Repo organised** — `src/assets/logo/source/` (Ricardo's SVGs),
      `src/assets/team-photos/` (portraits + future real photos).
- [x] **HTML blobs** — generated output, left alone as instructed.
- [x] **Docs synced** (README, CONTRIBUTING, .agents/*).

### Decisions taken while Ricardo was away

- Conselho Fiscal = 3 people, Mesa da Assembleia = 3 (counts not given;
  change in `src/content/team/pt/`).
- Department name expansions as stated by Ricardo; descriptions updated to
  match (DREE now talks about schools + business relations).
- Sparks "blink in" = quick three-step blink, once, at the end of the write.

### Still open (need Ricardo)

- DL (6) and DCI (5) headcounts — my guesses.
- Área de Sócio data source in v1 (mock + email path today).
- Real IBAN / MB WAY (placeholders today).
- Real team photos → drop into `src/assets/team-photos/` and set `photo:`
  (8 real photos in place today; the rest of the roster still shows generated
  portraits).

## Ricardo's batch (24 Oct)

- [x] **Wordmark writes as ONE single stroke** — the multi-stroke model is
      gone; the k follows Ricardo's reference trace verbatim
      (`src/assets/logo/source/k-route.txt`), the l draws the right loop
      first, the pencil is the real brush width (62) with a soft edge, and
      a yellow marker dot rides the leading edge. `.agents/wordmark.md`
      records the model, the knobs and the verification numbers.
- [x] **Favicon = the three strokes** — `public/favicon.svg` is the wordmark's
      three yellow strokes again (as in commit `8670031`); the lightbulb
      favicon is gone.
- [x] **Newton's cradle: icons inside the balls** — each value's icon is
      stamped on its own ball (path data sourced from `src/lib/icons.ts`,
      drawn through `Path2D`); the caption legend is gone (labels live in the
      canvas `aria-label`). Bigger: the cradle takes the width left beside
      the prose (`grid-template-columns: 38rem 1fr` on `.about-flow`).
      Seamless: no card chrome, the canvas sits straight on the page.
- [x] **Light/dark switch** — proposal 1, **a lâmpada**, is built
      (`ThemeToggle.astro` + `Icon name="bulb"`): the mascot bulb is lit
      yellow with a soft glow in light mode, off in dark ("acender/apagar").
- [x] **Language selector** — proposal 1, **Segmented PT | EN**, is built
      (`LanguageSwitch.astro`): both languages visible, active segment
      filled, one click, no menu, same control in the mobile nav.
- [x] **One consistent icon system** — the whole set is redrawn on one grid
      (24×24, 2px stroke, round caps/joins) and owned by `src/lib/icons.ts`
      (single source of truth for `Icon.astro` and the cradle's in-ball
      glyphs). Home cards get a mark chip per kind of content (events =
      ticket, news = newspaper, projects = flask), section heads carry the
      same chip, and the header menu, chevron and footer socials are drawn
      from the same set — no one-off inline SVGs left.

## Original dump + first follow-ups

## Brand & identity

- [x] **Lightbulb logo + favicon** — `lampada.svg` (Ricardo's SVG) is the mark,
      svgo-optimised (29 KB), served from `/lampada.svg`; originals kept
      untouched at the repo root. (Favicon later became the three strokes —
      see the 24 Oct batch.)
- [x] **One-stroke handwritten "plink" wordmark** — `nome.svg` (Ricardo's SVG),
      ink + sparks recoloured through tokens (dark mode flips the ink).
- [x] **The wordmark writes itself in front of the user** — pen-route mask reveal
      on the home hero, `prefers-reduced-motion` shows the end state.
- [x] **All graphics are icons/SVG** — theme icons, flags, dummy portraits and
      brand marks are all local SVG.

## Theme & language

- [x] **Light + dark mode with a manual toggle** — the bulb switch in the header
      (see above), persists across pages, OS preference fallback without JS
      (`/theme.js`, documented in AGENTS.md along with `/about-play.js` and
      `/robot.js`).
- [x] **Dark scheme parity** — palette lifts in dark; `npm run contrast` green.
- [x] **Language switcher** — the segmented PT | EN control (see above); the
      flag dropdown of the first iteration is retired.

## Navbar / interaction bugs (explicit asks)

- [x] **Remove the "downglow" on navbar buttons** — the accent bar under the
      active nav item is gone (weight + colour carry the state now); the
      language dropdown had a soft shadow, also removed.
- [x] **Fix the page stutter when clicking navbar buttons** — cause found: the
      theme toggle popped into the navbar at DOMContentLoaded on every page
      load (layout jump). It now reveals via `html.js` set before first paint.
      Dev-server latency measured: 15–20 ms, not the cause.
- [x] **Remove the after-click effects on buttons** — hover lift + sticker
      shadow gone.

## Sócios (membership)

- [x] **Split "Sócios" into two pages**:
  - [x] **Tornar-me Sócio** (`/pt/tornar-me-socio/`, `Join.astro` + `join.md`) —
        sign-up form + the benefits of being an associate + the 1 € fee.
  - [x] **Área de Sócio** (`/pt/area-de-socio/`, `Members.astro` +
        `members.md`) — members check their personal info, status, fees;
        static placeholder with a clear path to real access (mock + email
        route; no backend in v1 — data source still open above).
- [x] **No membership spam on the front page** — one quiet link at the bottom
      of the home (`home.joinQuiet`), never a pitch.

## New pages

- [x] **Donations page** (Doações, `/pt/doacoes/`) — what money buys
      (5/25/100 € tiers), IBAN / MB WAY placeholders, transparency note.
- [x] **Sponsors page** (Apoios, `/pt/apoios/`) — three tiers, "os níveis são
      conversas, não catálogos", become-a-sponsor CTA.

## Content

- [x] **Team page rework**:
  - [x] **Full department names** spelled out (expansions PLACEHOLDER until
        Ricardo confirms): Direção, DREE, DP, DL, DCI.
  - [x] **Headcounts**: Direção 4, DREE 5, DP 7, DL 6, DCI 5 (27 total;
        DL/DCI are guesses — see questions).
  - [x] **Big dummy profile pictures** — `scripts/avatars.mjs` generates a
        distinct SVG portrait per member (seeded by name).
  - [x] **Carousel per department** — CSS scroll-snap, focusable region,
        arrow keys scroll, zero JS.
- [x] **More events** — 10 placeholder events, split 4 past / 6 upcoming as
      of today (status is derived from dates, so the split happens on its own).
- [x] **About page redesign** — mission statement first, prose beside the
      cradle, values as colour panels, department map with accents; no longer
      reads like a wiki entry.

## Design & tone

- [x] **Design overhaul — stop being square and bland** — soft radii
      (`--radius-s/…/pill`), palette-identity panels and cards, the mark chips,
      the line-follower robot down the page, the playable cradle.
- [x] **Use the palette** — blue, pink, yellow, green, orange all carry real
      screen time (departments, value panels, listing cards, accents).
- [x] **Voice** — funny and easygoing, serious when it matters (mission,
      money): copy pass done across pages (e.g. "o café é levado muito a
      sério", "os níveis são conversas, não catálogos"). Real content should
      keep this register.
- [x] **The three cover PNGs** — resolved as "drop": no content entry sets
      `cover:` any more and detail pages only render a cover when present, so
      the near-identical art is never shown. The files remain in
      `src/assets/covers/` (nothing gets deleted without Ricardo's OK — see
      question below).

## Plumbing & housekeeping

- [x] **Routes + nav + UI strings for the new pages** — `members`, `donations`
      in `routes.ts`/`PAGE_KEYS`, strings in `ui.ts`, footer links + cross-links
      from Join. (The "three locales" of the old list is stale: there are two,
      `pt` + `en-gb`, and both build.)
- [x] **README/AGENTS/.agents sync** — repo map complete (Logo, Bulb, Flag,
      ThemeToggle, Playground, Values, MemberForm, PlaceholderLink;
      penpath.py, verify.mjs; the three client scripts), font row fixed
      (Bricolage, wght-only variant), page keys in CONTRIBUTING and
      content-model, theme.js decision recorded.
- [x] **Verification** — full pass below.

## Verification pass (25 Oct 2026)

All measured against the **built** output (a worktree at HEAD, served
statically — the dev server injects ~1 MB of Vite/toolbar JS and must never be
measured):

- `npm run build` → `astro check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npm run contrast`: all pairs pass, light + dark.
- `node scripts/verify.mjs` (now including the keyboard items): 320 px
  overflow, one `h1`, no heading jumps, skip link first, no console errors,
  reduced-motion end state, mobile `<details>` menu operable, project filters
  operable — all pass on the 8 pt pages.
- Lighthouse 13.5.0 (mobile emulation): performance **98–100**, accessibility
  / best practices / SEO **100** on /pt/, /pt/projetos/, /pt/noticias/,
  /pt/noticias/apresentacao-plink/, /pt/doacoes/.
- Page weight (home, excl. images): **65 KB** (HTML 16 + CSS 7 + JS 2 gz,
  font 40 KB woff2) — the ≤ 150 KB budget holds after switching the font to
  the weight-only variable file (−91 KB).
- Known noise in the working tree at the time of writing: the in-flight
  `Logo.astro` work-in-progress renders `<image href="[object Object]">` in
  the hero masks (404s in the console) and carries a ts(6133) hint. That is
  uncommitted WIP by the logo pass, not a shipped regression — HEAD is clean.

## Questions for Ricardo

1. Department full names: real expansions for DREE / DP / DL / DCI?
2. DL and DCI headcounts ("etc.")?
3. Área de Sócio "check their info": where does the data come from in v1 —
   external form link, email, or a placeholder mock-up?
4. Donation details: real IBAN / MB WAY now or keep placeholders?
5. **New:** the three cover PNGs in `src/assets/covers/` are now unreferenced
   — OK to delete them, or keep for future content?
